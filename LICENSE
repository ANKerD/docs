Non-commercial use means that users may not sell, profit from, or commercialize
OPENNEBULA materials or works derived from them. The guidelines below are
intended to help users determine whether or not their use of OPENNEBULA
materials would be permitted by OPENNEBULA under the “non-commercial”
restriction. Note that there are additional requirements (attribution and share
alike) spelled out in our license[1].

Commercialization is prohibited. Users may not directly sell or profit from
OPENNEBULA materials or from works derived from OPENNEBULA materials. Example: A
company may not offer courses based on OPENNEBULA materials if participants pay
a fee for those courses and the business intends to profit as a result.

Determination of commercial vs. non-commercial purpose is based on the use, not
the user. Materials may be used by individuals, institutions, governments,
corporations, or other business whether for-profit or non-profit so long as the
use itself is not a commercialization of the materials or a use that is directly
intended to generate sales or profit. Example: A corporation may use OPENNEBULA
materials for internal professional development and training purposes.ç
