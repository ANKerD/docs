OneGate
========

OneGate allows Virtual Machine guests to pull and push VM information from OpenNebula. Users and administrators can use it to gather metrics, detect problems in their applications, and trigger OneFlow elasticity rules from inside the VM.

For Virtual Machines that are part of a Multi-VM Application (Service), they can also retrieve the Service information directly from OneGate and trigger actions to reconfigure the service or pass information among different VMs.
