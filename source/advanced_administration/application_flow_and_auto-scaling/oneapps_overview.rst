OneFlow
========

OneFlow allows users and administrators to define, execute and manage multi-tiered applications, or services composed of interconnected Virtual Machines with deployment dependencies between them. Each group of Virtual Machines is deployed and managed as a single entity, and is completely integrated with the advanced :ref:`OpenNebula user and group management <auth_overview>`.

Benefits
========

-  Define multi-tiered applications (services) as collection of applications
-  Manage multi-tiered applications as a single entity
-  Automatic execution of services with dependencies
-  Provide configurable services from a catalog and self-service portal
-  Enable tight, efficient administrative control
-  Fine-grained access control for the secure sharing of services with other users
-  Auto-scaling policies based on performance metrics and schedule
