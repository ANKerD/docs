"This guide provides an overview of the OpenNebula monitoring subsystem. The "
"monitoring subsystem gathers information relative to the hosts and the "
"virtual machines, such as the host status, basic performance indicators, as "
"well as VM status and capacity consumption. This information is collected by"
" executing a set of static probes provided by OpenNebula. The output of "
"these probes is sent to OpenNebula in two different ways: using a push or a "
"pull paradigm. Below you can find a brief description of the two models and "
"when to use one or the other."

"In this model, each host periodically sends monitoring data via UDP to the "
"frontend which collects it and processes it in a dedicated module. This "
"distributed monitoring system resembles the architecture of dedicated "
"monitoring systems, using a lightweight communication protocol, and a push "
"model."
