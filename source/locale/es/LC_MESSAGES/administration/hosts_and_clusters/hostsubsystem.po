"A **Host** is a server that has the ability to run Virtual Machines and that"
" is connected to OpenNebula's Frontend server. OpenNebula can work with "
"Hosts with a heterogeneous configuration, i.e. you can connect Hosts to the "
"same OpenNebula with different hypervisors or Linux distributions as long as"
" these requirements are fulfilled:"

"The ``oneadmin`` account in any Host or the Frontend should be able to ssh "

"**Host Monitorization**: In order to keep track of the available resources "
