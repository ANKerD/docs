"This guide describes how to use the VMware network driver in OpenNebula. "
"This driver optionally provides network isolation through VLAN tagging. The "
"VLAN id will be the same for every interface in a given network, calculated "
"by adding a constant to the network id. It may also be forced by specifying "
"an VLAN\\_ID parameter in the :ref:`Virtual Network template "
"<vnet_template>`."
