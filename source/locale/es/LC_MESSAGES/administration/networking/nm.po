"The OpenNebula administrator must take into account that although this is a "
"powerful setup, it should be complemented with mechanisms to restrict "
"network access only to the expected Virtual Machines, to avoid situations in"
" which an OpenNebula user interacts with another user's VM. This "
"functionality is provided through Virtual Network Manager drivers. The "
