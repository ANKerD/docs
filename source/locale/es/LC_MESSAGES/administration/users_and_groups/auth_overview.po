"OpenNebula includes a complete user & group management system. Users in an "
"OpenNebula installation are classified in four types:"

"**Administrators**, an admin user belongs to an admin group (oneadmin or "

"**Service users**, a service user account is used by the OpenNebula services"

"The resources a user may access in OpenNebula are controlled by a "
"permissions system that resembles the typical UNIX one. By default, only the"
" owner of a resource (e.g. a VM or an image) can use and manage it. Users "
"can easily share the resources by granting use or manage permissions to "
"other users in her group or to any other user in the system."

"Upon group creation, an associated admin group can be also spawn, with a "
"admin user belonging to both of them. By default this user will be able to "
"create users in both groups, and manage non owned resources for the regular "
"group, through the CLI and/or a special Sunstone view. This group can also "
"be assigned with different Resource providers, in practice OpenNebula "
"clusters with all the associated resources of said cluster (hosts, "
"datastores and virtual networks). This allows for the management of virtual "
"datacenters using group functionality."

"Along with the users & groups the Auth Subsystem is responsible for the "

"Any interface to OpenNebula (CLI, Sunstone, Ruby or Java OCA) communicates "
"with the core using xml-rpc calls, that contain the user's session string, "
"which is authenticated by the OpenNebula core comparing the username and "
"password with the registered users."

"Each operation generates an authorization request that is checked against "
"the registered ACL rules. The core then can grant permission, or reject the "
"request."

"OpenNebula comes with a default set of ACL rules that enables a standard "
