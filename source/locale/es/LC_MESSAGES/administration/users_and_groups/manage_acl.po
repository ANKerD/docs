"The ACL authorization system enables fine-tuning of the allowed operations "
"for any user, or group of users. Each operation generates an authorization "
"request that is checked against the registered set of ACL rules. The core "
"then can grant permission, or reject the request."

"This allows administrators to tailor the user roles according to their "
"infrastructure needs. For instance, using ACL rules you could create a group"
" of users that can see and use existing virtual resources, but not create "
"any new ones. Or grant permissions to a specific user to manage Virtual "
"Networks for some of the existing groups, but not to perform any other "
"operation in your cloud. Some examples are provided at the end of this "
