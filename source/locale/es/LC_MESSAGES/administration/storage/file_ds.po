"The Files Datastore lets you store plain files to be used as VM kernels, "
"ramdisks or context files. The Files Datastore does not expose any special "
"storage mechanism but a simple and secure way to use files within VM "
"templates. There is a Files Datastore (datastore ID: 2) ready to be used in "
"OpenNebula."
