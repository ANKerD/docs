"A Datastore is any storage medium used to store disk images for VMs, "
"previous versions of OpenNebula refer to this concept as Image Repository. "
"Typically, a datastore will be backed by SAN/NAS servers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/administration/storage/sm.rst:9
msgid ""
"An OpenNebula installation can have multiple datastores of several types to "
"store disk images. OpenNebula also uses a special datastore, the *system "
"datastore*, to hold images of running VMs."

#: ../../source/administration/storage/sm.rst:18
msgid ""
":ref:`System <system_ds>`, to hold images for running VMs, depending on the "
"storage technology used these temporal images can be complete copies of the "
"original image, qcow deltas or simple filesystem links."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/administration/storage/sm.rst:20
msgid ""
"**Images**, stores the disk images repository. Disk images are moved, or "
"cloned to/from the System datastore when the VMs are deployed or shutdown; "
"or when disks are attached or snapshoted."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/administration/storage/sm.rst:22
msgid ""
":ref:`Files <file_ds>`, This is a special datastore used to store plain "
"files and not disk images. The plain files can be used as kernels, ramdisks "
"or context files."

"Image datastores can be of different type depending on the underlying "
"storage technology:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/administration/storage/sm.rst:26
msgid ""
":ref:`File-system <fs_ds>`, to store disk images in a file form. The files "
"are stored in a directory mounted from a SAN/NAS server."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/administration/storage/sm.rst:28
msgid ""
":ref:`vmfs <vmware_ds_datastore_configuration>`, a datastore specialized in "
"VMFS format to be used with VMware hypervisors. Cannot be mounted in the "
"OpenNebula front-end since VMFS is not \\*nix compatible."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/administration/storage/sm.rst:30
msgid ""
":ref:`LVM <lvm_drivers>`, The LVM datastore driver provides OpenNebula with "
"the possibility of using LVM volumes instead of plain files to hold the "
"Virtual Images. This reduces the overhead of having a file-system in place "
"and thus increases performance.."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/administration/storage/sm.rst:41
msgid ""
"The transfer mechanism is defined for each datastore. In this way a single "
"host can simultaneously access multiple datastores that uses different "
