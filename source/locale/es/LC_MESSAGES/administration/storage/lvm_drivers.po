"The LVM datastore driver provides OpenNebula with the possibility of using "
"LVM volumes instead of plain files to hold the Virtual Images. This reduces "
"the overhead of having a file-system in place and thus increases "
"performance."

"In a FS LVM datastore using the fs\\_lvm drivers (the now recommended LVM "

"When a Virtual Machine is instantiated OpenNebula will dynamically select "
"the system datastore. Let's assume for instance the selected datastore is "
"``104``. The virtual disk image will be copied from the stored image file "
"under the ``datastores`` directory and dumped into a LV under the Volume "
"Group: ``vg-one-104``. It follows that each node **must** have a cluster-"
"aware LVM Volume Group for every possible system datastore it may execute."
