"In a tiny installation with a few hosts, you can use OpenNebula with the two"

"Common large IT shops have multiple Data Centers (DCs), each one of them "
"consisting of several physical Clusters of infrastructure resources (hosts, "
"networks and storage). These Clusters could present different architectures "
"and software/hardware execution environments to fulfill the needs of "
"different workload profiles. Moreover, many organizations have access to "
"external public clouds to build hybrid cloud scenarios where the private "
"capacity of the Data Centers is supplemented with resources from external "
"clouds to address peaks of demand. Sysadmins need a single comprehensive "
"framework to dynamically allocate all these available resources to the "
"multiple groups of users."

"For example, you could have two Data Centers in different geographic "
