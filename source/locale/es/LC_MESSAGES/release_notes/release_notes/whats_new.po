"OpenNebula 4.6 introduces important improvements in several areas. The "
"provisioning model has been greatly simplify by supplementing user groups "
"with resource providers. This extended model, the Virtual Data Center, "
"offers an integrated and comprehensive framework for resource allocation and"
" isolation."

"Another important new feature has taken place in the OpenNebula core. It has"
" undergone a minor re-design of its internal data model to allow federation "
"of OpenNebula daemons. With OpenNebula Carina your users can access resource"
" providers from multiple data-centers in a federated way."

"With Carina the OpenNebula team has started a journey to deliver a more "
"intuitive and simpler provisioning experience for users. Our goal is level "
"the final user usability with the system administration and operation ones. "
"OpenNebula Carina brings a new cloud provisioning portal with a simpler, "
"clean and intuitive design. The Sunstone graphical interface has also been "
"tweaked to help implement common cloud admin workflows and improved in order"
" to support the new Marketplace version, which makes even easier for a user "
"to get a virtual application up and running."

"Finally, some other areas has received the attention of the OpenNebula "
