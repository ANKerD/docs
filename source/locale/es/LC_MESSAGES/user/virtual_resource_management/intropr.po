"The aim of a Private Cloud is not to expose to the world a cloud interface "
"to sell capacity over the Internet, but to **provide local cloud users and "
"administrators with a flexible and agile private infrastructure to run "
"virtualized service workloads within the administrative domain**. OpenNebula"
" virtual infrastructure interfaces expose **user and administrator "
"functionality for virtualization, networking, image and physical resource "
"configuration, management, monitoring and accounting**. This guide briefly "
"describes how OpenNebula operates to build a Cloud infrastructure. After "
"reading this guide you may be interested in reading the :ref:`guide "
"describing how an hybrid cloud operates <introh>` and the :ref:`guide "
"describing how a public cloud operates <introc>`."
