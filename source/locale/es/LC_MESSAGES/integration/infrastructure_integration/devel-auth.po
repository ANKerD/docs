"OpenNebula comes with an internal user/password way of authentication, this "
"is called ``core``. To be able to use other auth methods there is a system "
"that performs authentication with external systems. Authentication drivers "
"are responsible of getting the user credentials from OpenNebula database and"
" login and answer whether the authentication is correct or not."

msgid ""
"In the OpenNebula database there are two values saved for every user, this "
"is ``username`` and ``password``. When the driver used for authentication is"
" core (authenticated without an external auth driver) the password value "
"holds the SHA1 hash of the user's password. In case we are using other "
"authentication method this ``password`` field can contain any other "
"information we can use to recognize a user, for example, for x509 "
"authentication this field contains the user's public key."

"Authentication drivers are located at ``/var/lib/one/remotes/auth``. There "
"is a directory for each of authentication drivers with an executable inside "
"called ``authenticate``. The name of the directory has to be the same as the"
" user's auth driver we want to authenticate. For example, if a user has as "
"auth driver ``x509`` OpenNebula will execute the file "
"``/var/lib/one/remotes/auth/x509/authenticate`` when he performs an "
"OpenNebula action."
