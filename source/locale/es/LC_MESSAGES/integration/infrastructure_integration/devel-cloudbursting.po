"Cloud bursting is a model in which the local resources of a Private Cloud "
"are combined with resources from remote Cloud providers. The remote provider"
" could be a commercial Cloud service, such as Amazon EC2, or a partner "
"infrastructure running a different OpenNebula instance. Such support for "
"cloud bursting enables highly scalable hosting environments. For more "
"information on this model see the :ref:`Cloud Bursting overview <introh>`"
