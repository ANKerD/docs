"OpenNebula has been designed to be easily adapted to any infrastructure and "
"easily extended with new components. The result is a modular system that can"
" implement a variety of Cloud architectures and can interface with multiple "
"datacenter services. In this Guide we review the main interfaces of "
"OpenNebula, their use and give pointers to additional documentation for each"
" one."

"We have classified the interfaces in two categories: end-user cloud and "
"system interfaces. Cloud interfaces are primary used to develop tools "
"targeted to the end-user, and they provide a high level abstraction of the "
"functionality provided by the Cloud. On the other hand, the system "
"interfaces expose the full functionality of OpenNebula and are mainly used "
"to adapt and tune the behavior of OpenNebula to the target infrastructure."
