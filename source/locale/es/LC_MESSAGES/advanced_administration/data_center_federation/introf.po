"An OpenNebula Federation is a tightly coupled integration. All the instances"
" will share the same user accounts, groups, and permissions configuration. "
"Of course, access can be restricted to certain Zones, and also to specific "

"The typical scenario for an OpenNebula Federation is a company with several "
"Data Centers, distributed in different geographic locations. This low-level "
"integration does not rely on APIs, administrative employees of all Data "
"Centers will collaborate on the maintenance of the infrastructure. If your "
"use case requires a synergy with an external cloud infrastructure, that "
"would fall into the cloudbursting scenario."

"For the end users, a Federation allows them to use the resources allocated "
"by the Federation Administrators no matter where they are. The integration "
"is seamless, meaning that a user logged into the Sunstone web interface of a"
" Zone will not have to log out and enter the address of the other Zone. "
"Sunstone allows to change the active Zone at any time, and it will "
"automatically redirect the requests to the right OpenNebula at the target "
"Zone."

"In a Federation, there is a master OpenNebula zone and several slaves "
"sharing the database tables for users, groups, ACL rules, and zones. The "
"master OpenNebula is the only one that writes in the shared tables, while "
"the slaves keep a read-only local copy, and proxy any writing actions to the"
" master. This allows us to guarantee data consistency, without any impact on"
" the speed of read-only actions."

"The synchronization is achieved configuring MySQL to replicate certain "
"tables only. MySQL's replication is able to perform over long-distance or "
"unstable connections. Even if the master zone crashes and takes a long time "
"to reboot, the slaves will be able to continue working normally except for a"
" few actions such as new user creation or password updates."

"New slaves can be added to an existing Federation at any moment. Moreover, "
"the administrator can add a clean new OpenNebula, or import an existing "
"deployment into the Federation keeping the current users, groups, "
"configuration, and virtual resources."

"Regarding the OpenNebula updates, we have designed the database in such a "
"way that different OpenNebula versions will be able to be part of the same "
"Federation. While an upgrade of the local tables (VM, Image, VNet objects) "
"will be needed, new versions will keep compatibility with the shared tables."
" In practice, this means that when a new OpenNebula version comes out each "
"zone can be updated at a different pace, and the Federation will not be "
"affected."

"Regarding the administrator users, a Federtion will have a unique oneadmin "
