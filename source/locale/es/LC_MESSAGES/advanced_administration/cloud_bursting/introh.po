"Cloud bursting is a model in which the local resources of a Private Cloud "
"are combined with resources from remote Cloud providers. The remote provider"
" could be a commercial Cloud service, such as Amazon EC2, or a partner "
"infrastructure running a different OpenNebula instance. Such support for "
"cloud bursting enables highly scalable hosting environments."

"As you may know, OpenNebulaâ€™s approach to cloud bursting is quite unique. "
"The reason behind this uniqueness is the transparency to both end users and "
"cloud administrators to use and maintain the cloud bursting functionality. "
"The **transparency to cloud administrators** comes from the fact that a an "
"AWS EC2 region is modelled as any other host (albeit of potentially a much "
"bigger capacity), so the scheduler can place VMs in EC2 as it will do in any"
" other local host."

"On the other hand, the **transparency to end users** is offered through the "
"hybrid template functionality: the same VM template in OpenNebula can "
"describe the VM if it is deployed locally and also if it gets deployed in "
"Amazon EC2. So users just have to instantiate the template, and OpenNebula "
"will transparently choose if that is executed locally or remotely. A simple "
"template like the following is enough to launch Virtual Machines in Amazon "
"EC2:"
