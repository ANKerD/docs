The OpenNebula project would like to thank the `community members <http://www.opennebula.org/about:contributors>`__ and `users <http://www.opennebula.org/users:users>`__ who have contributed to this software release by being active with the discussions, answering user questions, or providing patches for bugfixes, features and documentation.

The new features for VDCs, Federations and OVA support in the Marketplace introduced in OpenNebula 4.6 were funded by `Produban <http://www.produban.com>`__ in the context of the Fund a Feature Program.

A series of vulnerabilities reported by `Dennis Felsch <http://nds.rub.de/chair/people/dfelsch/>`__ and `Mario Heiderich <http://nds.rub.de/chair/people/mheiderich/>`__ from the `Horst GÃ¶rtz Institute for IT-Security, Ruhr-University Bochum <http://hgi.rub.de/>`__, have been addressed and solved in OpenNebula 4.6.2. These vulnerabilites consist on Sunstone being vulnerable to malicious `CSRF exploits <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CSRF>`__ and vulnerabilities in the core XML sanitization leading to malformed XML exploits, which allowed for DoS attacks.
